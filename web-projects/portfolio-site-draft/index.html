    My name is Sean, and I am a senior at the University of Minnesota. I am majoring in Technical Writing and Communication. I am 31 years old, and I grew up in Minnesota. I currently live in Eden Prairie with my fianc√© and dog. Before starting college, I was in the United States Navy for six years. After I complete my degree in Technical Writing and Communication, I plan on going to law school.
